In this project, I developed a voice-controlled Tic-Tac-Toe game by mapping distinct verbal commands to corresponding game grid blocks. The system is seamlessly integrated with advanced speech recognition capabilities through the SpeechRecognition module, leveraging the Google Web Speech API to accurately interpret and process spoken input. This implementation involves a dynamic interface between the SR module and the game logic, ensuring real-time recognition and interaction, providing an intuitive and hands-free gameplay experience.
